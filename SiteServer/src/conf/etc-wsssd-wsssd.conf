# Output Units
#
# The output units configuration is used for when displaying the units
# in the console or log files. These settings will not affect the units
# displayed on the web app.
#
# The units that can be used for the output temperature are
# CELSIUS or FAHRENHEIT
#
OutputTempUnit CELSIUS
#
# The units that can be used for the output atmospheric pressure are
# INCHES or MILIMETERS or MB or HPA
#
OutputBarometerUnit HPA
#
# The units that can be used for the output rain amounts are
# IN or MM or COUNTS
#
OutputRainUnit MM
#
# The units that can be used for the output wind direction are
# DEGREES or CARDINAL
#
OutputWindDirUnit CARDINAL
#
# The units that can be used for the output wind speed are

# The Weather Station App server URL to forward the data to. This is the
# URL/Wesbsite address that displays the data from the weatherstation
#

#
# These are the performance logging settings. 
#
# The degraded performance latency threshold is the amount of milliseconds
# in which the Weather Station App server needs to respond. If the response
# is above this amount for a predefined amount of times in a row, an error 
# is logged
#
DegradedPerformanceLatencyThreshold 1000
#

#
# The degraded performance tollerance is the amount of times in a row
# the Weather Station App server response is above the threshold above. 
# If the amount of times the response is above this amount, the error is
# logged
#
DegradedPerformanceTollerance 3
#

#
# The Response Too Long threshold is the amount of milliseconds allowed
# for a single response to be considered okay. If it is above this amount
# the single response would be considered too slow and an error will be 
# reported immediately.
#
ResponseTooLongThreshold 2500

#
# Email Alert Settings
# 
# In this section, it is possible to specify an email account to send 
# critical service alerts to. One such alert is when the performance 
# of the App Server Host connection degrades according to the performance
# logging setting above. When the App Server takes too long to respond, 
# an email alert is sent to the specified recipient.
#

#
# The sending email account username/email address from which the email
# alerts will be send from
#
# SendingAccountUsernameEmail sender@gmail.com
#
# The sending email account sender display name that will be shown as the
# sender name in the recipient's mailbox.
#
# FromDisplayName Weather Dev
#
# The password used to authenticate the username/email with the smtp email
# server
#
# Password cihjgnlswxoie

#
# The destination email address that should be receiving alerts. Can only
# handle one recipient/email address. Future development will support 
# multiple
#
# DestinationEmail recipient@outlook.com

#
# The fully qualified domain name of the smpt server.
# Example: smtp.gmail.com
#
# SmtpServerFQDN smtp.gmail.com
#
# The smtp port used, usually it is 587, but could be something else. 
#
# SmtpPort 587
#
# Whether the connection is authenticated. Some smtp servers allow for 
# unauthenticated sending of email, such as private company servers. 
# In most cases this will be set to true, but can also be set to false

#
# In most cases these settings are not required to be changed. If

#
# This is the timout threshold in milliseconds for the live UDP packets 
# from the WeatherLink Live Device. If after this period the service/daemon 
# is still not able to get data from the WeatherLink Live device, the daemon
# will terminate and the service will stop. Errors will be logged.
#
# LiveUDPTimeOut 6000
#
# Sets the refresh update frequency. This is when all sensors' values
